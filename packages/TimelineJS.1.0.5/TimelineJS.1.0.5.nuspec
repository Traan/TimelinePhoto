    <releaseNotes>New version pushed in github.com September 07, 2012)

* Changed web thumb service to pagepeeker, tweaked flickr api size logic

* Pagepeeker seems to provide better thumbnails
  http://pagepeeker.com

* Flickr size logic was assuming the medium 800 size exists. 
  It doesn't anymore. This was causing enormous image sizes to load instead.
